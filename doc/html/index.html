<p>Overview</p>
<p>1.1 What the software does</p>
<p>In our program we successfully implemented all the basic features mentioned in the project topic description:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functioning tower defense game with basic graphics:</li>
<li>Enemies follow a single, non-branched path</li>
<li>Towers can shoot enemies inside their range</li>
<li>Game is lost if any enemy reaches the end of the path</li>
<li>Some money system, which gives more money per enemy killed and money is required to build towers</li>
<li>Two modes: placing towers, running a wave of enemies through the path (towers cannot be moved when enemies are on the map)</li>
<li>At least three different types of towers<ul>
<li>A basic tower that shoots enemies within its range</li>
<li>A tower that slows down enemies within its range</li>
<li>A tower that has extra-long range <br  />
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At least three different types of enemies<ul>
<li>A basic enemy</li>
<li>A tank enemy that has high health points, moves slow, and is immune to the tower slowing it down</li>
<li>An enemy that moves extra quickly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At least five different levels with increasing difficulty</li>
<li>Controlling the game by mouse: user can build/remove towers either between waves of enemies or without restrictions.</li>
<li>Simple user interface that shows information such as resources, number of waves/enemies etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these basic features, we added the following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple enemy paths</li>
<li>Our path has an intersection where the enemies choose the path randomly</li>
<li>Additional tower that increases money</li>
<li>Additional enemy type that can attack towers</li>
<li>The map is read from a txt-file</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions for building and using the software</p>
<p>3.1.1 External Library Requirements</p>
<p>Needed Libraries for Linux (most computers have them all). Mac and Windows also have them</p>
<p>freetype</p>
<p>x11</p>
<p>xrandr</p>
<p>udev</p>
<p>opengl</p>
<p>flac</p>
<p>ogg</p>
<p>vorbis</p>
<p>vorbisenc</p>
<p>vorbisfile</p>
<p>openal</p>
<p>pthread</p>
<p>Downloading the libraries:</p>
<p>sudo apt update</p>
<p>sudo apt install \ </p><pre class="fragment">libxrandr-dev \ 

libxcursor-dev \ 

libudev-dev \ 

libopenal-dev \ 

libflac-dev \ 

libvorbis-dev \ 

libgl1-mesa-dev \ 

libegl1-mesa-dev \ 

libdrm-dev \ 

libgbm-dev \ 

libfreetype-dev 
</pre><p>Also CMake needs to be installed</p>
<p>3.1.2 Running the software</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clone the repository <br  />
</li>
<li>Move to the repository and input the next commands to terminal</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>cd tower-defense-tran-duong-5/build/ <br  />
</li>
<li>cmake ..</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>cd bin</li>
<li>./CMakeSFMLProject <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2 Software Usage Guide</p>
<p>After starting the game, you will see the main menu screen that consists of:</p>
<p>The difficulty levels that can be chosen by clicking</p>
<p>The play button that starts the game with the chosen difficulty</p>
<p>The exit button that closes the program</p>
<p>After starting a game, you will enter the building state, where you can build and remove towers. Building towers costs money and you can see the amount of money you have in the top right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Towers:</p>
<p>Basic tower (red), cost 30</p>
<p>Slowing tower (blue), cost 50</p>
<p>Long range tower (yellow), cost 120</p>
<p>Money tower (black), costs 300</p>
<p>Building the tower is done by left-clicking the right color button and then right clicking a tile in which you want to place the tower; towers can be placed only on green tiles. By left-clicking a placed tower, it can be removed, and you will receive 50% of the cost back.</p>
<p>Leaving the building state and starting the attacking phase happens when the black button is pressed. After every enemy in the wave is defeated, a building phase will automatically start again.</p>
<p>The game ends when one enemy gets to the end of the path, and you will be shown an ending screen. By clicking the screen, you will get back to the main menu and a new game can be started.</p>
<p>Testing</p>
<p>Module Testing Due to the development nature of the project no third-party testing tool was used. Instead, the team relied on a combination of targeted print statements and the c++ gdb debugger. It can be said that the testing method employed was manual testing.</p>
<p>Testing Methods The primary testing method was using the GDB debugger integrated into the VSCode C++ development stack. This follows by adding breakpoints into the selected lines of code and checking whether the breakpoints are being hit and variable in interest in being modified or the desired function is being called.</p>
<p>Testing Outcomes During the course of the projects any failed test ie breakpoints that were not being hit or functions that was not being called, the call stack was used to determine the cause of the issue and fixed manually.</p>
<p>Work log</p>
<p>5.1 Division of Work and Responsibilities</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, during the planning we divided the work and responsibilities for each member, but that was not very strictly followed and at our weekly meetings we picked a feature or subject for every member to work on. During the weekly (and towards the end, more frequent) meetings we merged our branches together for a working game and in addition to that we also tried to develop our game together as much as possible.</p>
